# Image-Generation-using-stable-diffusion-Comfy-UI-

This is a part of AICTE internship on AI: TechSaksham, a joint CSR initiative of MIcrosoft & SAP. 

I have worked with ComfyUI. Learned about the layers working and then generated images. This is helpful for understanding how Gen-AI works in image generation. For more details I will attach the document.
